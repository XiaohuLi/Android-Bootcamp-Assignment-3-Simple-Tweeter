Please review my assignment 3.

Here is what I accomplished:

1) All required feature

2) User can see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet
    
3) Polished the UI a bit

Here is the gif:

You may notice that the "retweet" icon is missing -- it was there in my previous assignment but as long as I move that into fragment, it started to behave strangely. I tried multiple ways to adjust the relative location of that icon but none of them works. Please let me know if you can find anything wrong in my code: https://github.com/XiaohuLi/Android-Bootcamp-Assignment-3-Simple-Tweeter/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/item_tweet.xml
